# ee.dyn: Emotion Expression Dynamics Toolbox
to install run: 
devtools::install_github("natehall329/ee.dyn")


Note that the package is under development and the main functions have not yet been pushed to the repo. If you are interested in using the ee dynamics approach that we report in our paper, please reach out to natehall@unc.edu.

Also note that the outlier handling capabilities of the get_gimme_attrs function are currently broken. feel free to submit a pull request or to do your preferred outlier handling approaches outside of the function. 

Thanks,
NTH
