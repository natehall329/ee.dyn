\title{Compute and Plot Autocorrelations and Cross-Correlations for Emotion Variables}
\usage{
ee_acf_ccf(data, emo_vars, lag.max = 20, cores = 1, plot_path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing time-series data for emotional variables, as well as an `id` column for subjects.}

\item{emo_vars}{A character vector of column names representing the emotional variables to analyze.}

\item{lag.max}{Integer. The maximum lag to compute for ACF and CCF. Default is 20.}

\item{cores}{Integer. Number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing. Default is 1.}

\item{plot_path}{Character. Path to save the resulting PDF file containing the grid of ACF/CCF plots. If `NULL`, no plot is saved. Default is `NULL`.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing:
\describe{
  \item{\code{Var1}, \code{Var2}}{Variable pairs for which ACF/CCF was computed.}
  \item{\code{lab}}{Formatted label for the variable pair.}
  \item{\code{accf_results}}{A list-column containing data frames of lags and average ACF/CCF values.}
  \item{\code{accf_plot}}{A list-column containing ggplot objects for each ACF/CCF visualization.}
  \item{\code{acf}}{A character column indicating whether the plot is an autocorrelation (\code{"acf"}) or a cross-correlation (\code{"ccf"}).}
}
}
\description{
This function computes autocorrelations (ACF) and cross-correlations (CCF) for a given set of emotional variables across subjects.
It allows for visualization of the results in a grid of plots, with options to save the plots to a PDF file.
}
\details{
- For each subject, ACF is computed for individual variables and CCF is computed for variable pairs.
- Plots are generated for each variable pair and optionally saved as a PDF in a grid layout.
- The function uses parallel processing to speed up computation for large datasets.
